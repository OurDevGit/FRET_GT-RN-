        a higher pitch. This is often done using two or three fingers 
        at the same time, which is called a reinforced bend. This 
        technique requires a lot of physical strength, and close attention must 
        be paid to the accuracy of the pitch that is being bent into. The most 
        common bends use a half step or whole step interval. </font></td>

        bent is then released back to its original pitch. The bend and release 
        technique is used to create the sound of a Melody with three parts: the 
        pitch of the original note, then the higher pitch of the bent note, and 
        then the pitch of the original note again. Each pitch within this three 
        part Melody will also have its own rhythmic value, so close attention 
        must be paid to the left hand bending technique as well as the rhythmic

        must be able to bend the string to the correct pitch while also

    <td class="def"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The music term legatto 
        is used to describe a series of notes that are played with a smooth or 
        flowing sound. On the guitar, this means that notes will be sounded by 
    the fingers of the left hand without picking the strings. This is done using a 
        combination of three different techniques, which are the &quot;Hammer On&quot;, 
        the &quot;Pull Off&quot;, and the &quot;Trill&quot; techniques. The combination of these techniques 
        together are used to create a legatto sound. To play legatto, the left hand fingers must be strong enough 
        to sound notes on the fretboard without picking each string individually. 
        Legatto techniques are also referred to as &quot;Slurs&quot; because the 
        notes are not picked individually but are slurred together.</font></td>

        &quot;wiggle&quot; or &quot;shake&quot; the string. The left hand finger will continue to 
        fret the note, but the tip of the finger moves the string side to side, 
        which adds a &quot;shaking&quot; sound. Vibrato can be 
        played using any finger of the left hand, and can be done on any fretted 
        note on any string. Guitarists often use many different variations of 
        the vibrato technique.</font></td>
